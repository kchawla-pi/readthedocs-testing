This repo serves to test and verify the documentation that I am writing for the Read the Docs project. 

This is the root of the code.

Its has the directories::

    - /src/
    - /docs/

It has the files::

    1. /index.rst  (this file, serving as readme)
    2. /requirements.txt (the requirementsfor the project, not its documentation)
